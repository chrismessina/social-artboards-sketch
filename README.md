## Installation
Start the installation routine (once) within the Sketch App itself. Either goto the plugins menu and select Social Media Artboards -> Install Artboard Presets

### What's inside
A couple of common social media artboard presets with different pixel dimensions. If you hear these sizes change, please feel free to report an issue in this repo.

### Social media what?!
Profile, cover, header + supplementary image sizes for the platforms like:

 - Twitter
 - Facebook
 - Google+
 - LinkedIn
 - Pintrest
 - Dribbble

 - Youtube

You can fork and contribute to the code and extend this package - I will happily merge any tested PRs.
